## Things to add in this codebase

### for backend

- make the backend correct (the backend is failing because of probably db.js file to look for if it is correct and server/routes/user.js also)

### for frontend

- update the signin page like the signup page
- add a '/me' route if the user signs in or signs up on the page
- if someone changes the authorization token then the it should redirect to /signup page or /signin page(bassically it should go through the /me route)
- clicking the sendmoney button the id is coming as undefined(probably when the backend will get fixed this id will also come as per my understanding)
